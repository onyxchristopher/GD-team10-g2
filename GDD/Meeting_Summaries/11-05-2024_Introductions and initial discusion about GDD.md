# GD-team10-g2
MEETING SUMMARY
May 11th, 2024
This marks the very first meeting of this group that was held through Slack. Introductions were made, backgrounds were shared, and timezones were discussed in relation to the schedule of weekly meetings. It was determined that Thursdays at 2pm would work best for all the attendees of the meeting, but it was noted that this meeting time can change occasionally. The group members then had a brainstorming session regarding the GDD which is to be submitted on the first week of July. Questions were raised about the Group Design Document, specifically about the City Game Theme. Several ideas were shared - including a rhythmic based game, a horror adventure game, and a car driving game. It was agreed by the group members that they will be taking the upcoming week to brainstorm even more ideas until they finally decide on a singular concept by next week’s meeting. The plan for next week’s meeting is to start delegating tasks and move forward with executing the group’s chosen concept.
