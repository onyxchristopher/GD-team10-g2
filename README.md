# GD-team10-g2
Games Development groupwork

I suggest we keep the GDD in its respective file together with Meeting summaries and the schedule for its production. 
Currently I have uploaded the schedule and the GDD as .xlxs and .rfd respectively as I donÂ´t have too much experience with markdown. This way we can all have a copy of this files or alternatively we could just use a shared Google docs/sheets link. Feel free to suggest any other way of organizing the documents.
